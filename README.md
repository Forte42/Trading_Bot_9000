# Trading_Bot_9000

This software is a crypto trading bot designed to work with Binance.US.  AS currently configured it runs on the Binance.US test API (?paper trading). The bot can play both the long and short side of the crypto market, but due to limitations on the Binance test API, only the long side is currently functional.  For full trading, the actual Binance API is available to anyone with a funded Binance.US account.
